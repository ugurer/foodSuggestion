## Information We Collect

### Location Data
We access your device's precise location (GPS and network-based) solely to provide location-based food and restaurant recommendations. This data is processed locally on your device or sent directly to Google Places API to find nearby restaurants. **We do not store your location data on our servers.**

We store your dietary preferences (Vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten-Free) locally on your device using AsyncStorage. This data is used to filter food suggestions and tailor the AI recommendations.

## Third-Party Services

### Google Places API
We use Google Places API to search for restaurants near you. When you use the "Search" or "Nearby Suggestions" feature, your location coordinates and search query are sent to Google. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information.

### Gemini AI (Google)
We use Google's Gemini AI to generate personalized food suggestions. Your mood, city name, and dietary preferences may be sent to the AI model to generate text responses.

## Data Security
We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
